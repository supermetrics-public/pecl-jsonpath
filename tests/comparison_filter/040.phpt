--TEST--
Test filter expression with equals object
--SKIPIF--
<?php if (!extension_loaded("jsonpath")) print "skip"; ?>
--DESCRIPTION--
Test a dictionary as an expression operand. This is currently unrecognized by
the grammar, so a lexing error is returned. Dictionary operand support can be
implemented in the future if users signal that this is generally useful.
